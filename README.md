This project detects malaria-infected cells from microscopic images using a deep learning model based on EfficientNetB3. Leveraging transfer learning, the model achieves up to 97% validation accuracy on the NIH Malaria Dataset. It classifies images into two categories: parasitized and uninfected. The notebook includes image preprocessing, data augmentation, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results like accuracy curves and confusion matrix. It serves as a reliable tool for early malaria diagnosis. To run the project, install dependencies from requirements.txt and execute the Jupyter notebook. Future improvements include Grad-CAM visualizations and web app deployment for real-time prediction.
